## PHARMACY MANAGEMENT

### Problem Statement & Requirements Definition
Traditional pharmacy administration systems are generally fragmented and manual, resulting in inefficiencies, errors, and missed opportunities in inventory, prescriptions, and sales management. Manual inventory tracking, prescription handling, and sales transactions are error-prone, time-consuming, and lack customer engagement. There is a need for a modernised system that integrates data, automates tasks, and empowers all stakeholders.

The Pharmacy Management System aims to improve pharmaceutical operations by providing a comprehensive web application that meets the demands of administrators, pharmacists, and customers. This unified platform will serve as a hub for keeping accurate records of pharmaceutical stocks, supporting effective inventory management, improving customer engagement, and giving critical insights for informed decision-making.

The system's main purpose is to automate and streamline numerous pharmacy processes such as inventory management, prescription handling, and sales recording, thus eliminating manual errors and drastically minimizing the time required to do these operations.  The system would also enable pharmacists to digitally create and monitor prescriptions. This includes matching prescribed medications to patients and keeping a record of prescriptions for future reference. The system will make it simpler to record sales transactions, ensure accurate billing, and update inventory levels as needed. Customers will also be able to examine their prescription history, order prescription refills online, and receive notifications when their medications are available.

By delivering a consolidated, user-friendly, and data-driven platform, the Pharmacy Management System aims to modernize pharmaceutical operations. This system attempts to improve pharmaceutical sector efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction by centralizing information, automating procedures, and improving client interactions. The ultimate goal is to improve inventory management, assist informed decision-making, and contribute to the pharmacy's overall growth.
